The only Gym in LA focusing on strength training over 40. A note from the Founder Strength training changed my life. From the moment I picked up my first weight, I was hooked. It wasn’t just about building muscle or looking a certain way—it was about the feeling. The confidence. The control. The realization that I could push past limits I once thought were set in stone. It became my passion, my escape, my driving force. I trained relentlessly, setting bigger and bigger goals, challenging myself in ways I never imagined. But what started as something personal—something just for me—slowly transformed into something greater. When I became a personal trainer, everything clicked. The hours I had spent pushing myself weren’t just for my own growth—they were preparing me for something bigger. I wasn’t meant to just train for myself.",
